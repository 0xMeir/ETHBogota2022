Zero Knowledge (ZK) Privacy Layer for NFTs

Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15qLunfwrxsN7oyHCubAirOaaZS0QT7LVqo63g4U8Rzs/edit#slide=id.g163dd48431d_0_9

**How It Works**

- User logs onto Aztec Network
- Users mint NFT (s) on ETH Mainnet via our Zero Knowledge Bridge
- NFTs are minted and held in the Aztec ZK Rollup Bridge Contract
- zkNFTs on Aztec privately attribute minted NFTs to the appropriate users
- zkNFTs are redeemed for ETH Mainnet NFTs whenever you want


**Potential Use Cases**
- Acquiring large NFT stakes privately - prevent on - chain snooping
- Art Collectors can keep their ownership status private
- Event / Ticket NFTs - Held without associating a person to a - specific location
- Location-based NFTs - don’t want people to know you’re there
- Membership NFTs  you want to keep private
